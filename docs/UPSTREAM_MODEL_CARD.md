# Clef-Flash

- **Announcement:** [Clef decision models on the Cloudflare blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/clef-decision-models)
- **Decision Index leaderboard:** [clef-evals.workers-ai-mle.workers.dev](https://clef-evals.workers-ai-mle.workers.dev)

Clef-Flash is a 9B multimodal model that turns a state and a schema of typed
questions into decisions. It reads the state as text, JSON, images, or video, and returns a
probability for every allowed option of every question in a single forward pass. There is no
free-form text generation and no output parsing.

The Clef-Flash API is fully compatible with Jev and SystemOne.

Clef-Flash is post-trained from [Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B). See
[Clef](https://huggingface.co/Cloudflare/clef) for the
larger variant.

## Model

- **Backbone:** Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B with its vision encoder, stored as standard sharded safetensors.
- **Joint schema head:** a small transformer head that reads the backbone's final hidden states,
  routes evidence from the state to each question, and scores all options of all questions jointly.
- **Output:** one logit per allowed option for each question. Apply a softmax per question to get
  probabilities.

## Usage

Tested with `torch` 2.11 and `transformers` 5.10.2 on a single H200. Image and video inputs also
need `pillow`.

```python
import sys

import torch
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

path = snapshot_download("Cloudflare/clef-flash")
sys.path.insert(0, path)
from joint_schema_model import collate_records, encode_record, load_release_model

model, processor = load_release_model(path, device="cuda")

record = {
    "state": {"invoice": {"vendor": "Acme", "total": 1250.0, "currency": "USD", "status": "overdue"}},
    "questions": {
        "status": {
            "type": "choice",
            "instructions": "What is the invoice status?",
            "criteria": {"paid": "Invoice is paid.", "overdue": "Invoice is past due.", "draft": "Not sent."},
        },
        "large": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is the total above 1000 USD?"},
    },
}

encoded = encode_record(processor.tokenizer, record, processor=processor)
batch = collate_records([encoded], processor.tokenizer.pad_token_id, torch.device("cuda"))
with torch.inference_mode():
    logits = model(batch)[0]

for question, question_logits in zip(encoded.questions, logits):
    probabilities = question_logits.float().softmax(-1).tolist()
    print(question.question_id, dict(zip(question.option_ids, probabilities)))
```

### Jev / SystemOne API

`systemone` takes a Jev/SystemOne `POST /v1/systemone` request body and returns the same response
body: `model`, `answers` keyed by question ID, and `usage`. A `choice` answer has `choice`,
`confidence`, and `probabilities`; a `score` answer has the expected `score`, `confidence`, `legend`,
and `probabilities`; a `noul` answer has the probability of true. `instructions` is optional, and
`images` and `videos` may be added to the request.

```python
from joint_schema_model import systemone

response = systemone(model, processor, {
    "model": "clef-flash",
    "state": "Our checkout started returning errors and orders are blocked.",
    "questions": {
        "department": {
            "type": "choice",
            "instructions": "Which team should handle the message?",
            "criteria": {"billing": "Payments or invoices", "technical": "Bugs or outages"},
        },
        "urgency": {"type": "score", "criteria": ["Can wait", "This week", "Today"]},
        "outage": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is a service down?"},
    },
})
print(response["answers"])
```

### Images and video

Add `images` (PIL images) or `videos` (frame arrays) to the record and pass the processor to
`encode_record`. Optional processor arguments go in `media_kwargs`.

```python
from PIL import Image

record = {
    "state": {"task": "Review the attached receipt."},
    "images": [Image.open("receipt.jpg")],
    "questions": {
        "legible": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is the receipt total legible?"},
    },
}
encoded = encode_record(processor.tokenizer, record, processor=processor)
```

Text-only and multimodal records can be mixed in the same batch.

## Input format

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `state` | Any string or JSON value describing the situation to decide on |
| `images`, `videos` | Optional lists of images or video frame arrays |
| `media_kwargs` | Optional keyword arguments for the image/video processor |
| `questions` | Mapping of question ID to question |

Each question has:

- `type`: `noul` (true/false), `choice` (named options), or `score` (ordered options)
- `instructions`: what to decide; optional, and the question ID is used when it is omitted
- `criteria`: for `choice`, a mapping of option ID to description; for `score`, a list of option
  descriptions indexed from 0; for `noul`, optional descriptions for `true` and `false`

`encode_record` accepts `max_length` (default 16,384 tokens) and `max_state_tokens` to bound the input.

## Results

### Decision Index

Per-benchmark results from our internal run of the [Decision Index](https://clef-evals.workers-ai-mle.workers.dev) 0.2.1 suite. Scores are percentages; ForecastBench is a Brier score, where lower is better. The last two rows are request latency in milliseconds, where lower is better. The best value in each row is in bold.
